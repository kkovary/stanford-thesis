\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

I wish to thank my advisor, Mary, for giving me the opportunity to work in such a wonderful and inspiring research group and for giving me her invaluable support. She has been a tremendous mentor for me and more importantly, it has been an honor to be her first graduate student. I am also grateful to all my lab mates for the spectacular working atmosphere and cooperation.

I would like to extend my special appreciation to the committee members for providing timely and constructive feedback on my thesis work, without which this work could have never become what it is today.

I would like to thank the Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, my classmates, and fellow graduate students, who have created such an outstanding environment, for providing infinite amount of support. Moreover, I would like to thank everyone in the CSB administration for taking care of administrative aspects for graduate students.

Lastly, I would like to thank my family for their support during my time at Stanford. My warmest thanks belong to them for a lifetime of love, care, and support.
