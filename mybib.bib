abstract = {Despite large cell-to-cell variations in the concentrations of individual signaling proteins, cells transmit signals correctly. This phenomenon raises the question of what signaling systems do to prevent a predicted high failure rate. Here we combine quantitative modeling, RNA interference, and targeted selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry, and we show for the ubiquitous and fundamental calcium signaling system that cells monitor cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) levels and adjust in parallel the concentrations of the store-operated Ca(2+) influx mediator stromal interaction molecule (STIM), the plasma membrane Ca(2+) pump plasma membrane Ca-ATPase (PMCA), and the ER Ca(2+) pump sarco/ER Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA). Model calculations show that this combined parallel regulation in protein expression levels effectively stabilizes basal cytosolic and ER Ca(2+) levels and preserves receptor signaling. Our results demonstrate that, rather than directly controlling the relative level of signaling proteins in a forward regulation strategy, cells prevent transmission failure by sensing the state of the signaling pathway and using multiple parallel adaptive feedbacks.},

abstract = {The EGF-stimulated ERK/MAPK pathway is a key conduit for cellular proliferation signals and a therapeutic target in many cancers. Here, we characterize two central quantitative aspects of this pathway: the mechanism by which signal strength is encoded and the response curve relating signal output to proliferation. Under steady-state conditions, we find that ERK is activated in discrete, asynchronous pulses with frequency and duration determined by extracellular concentrations of EGF spanning the physiological range. In genetically identical sister cells, cell-to-cell variability in pulse dynamics influences the decision to enter S phase. While targeted inhibition of EGFR reduces the frequency of ERK activity pulses, inhibition of MEK reduces their amplitude. Continuous response curves measured in multiple cell lines reveal that proliferation is effectively silenced only when ERK pathway output falls below a threshold of ∼10{\%}, indicating that high-dose targeting of the pathway is necessary to achieve therapeutic efficacy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Here, we show that stochastic ERK activity pulses regulate cell proliferation rates in a cell density-dependent manner. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor revealed that stochastic ERK activity pulses fired spontaneously or propagated from adjacent cells. Frequency, but not amplitude, of ERK activity pulses exhibited a bell-shaped response to the cell density and correlated with cell proliferation rates. Consistently, synthetic ERK activity pulses generated by a light-switchable CRaf protein accelerated cell proliferation. A mathematical model clarified that 80{\%} and 20{\%} of ERK activity pulses are generated by the noise and cell-to-cell propagation, respectively. Finally, RNA sequencing analysis of cells subjected to the synthetic ERK activity pulses suggested the involvement of serum responsive factor (SRF) transcription factors in the gene expression driven by the ERK activity pulses. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {To evaluate the physiological functions of beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-adrenoceptors (ARs) in brown adipose tissue, the lipolytic and respiratory effects of various adrenergic agonists and antagonists were studied in rat brown adipocytes. The beta-agonists stimulated both lipolysis and respiration (8-10 times above basal levels), with the following order of potency (concentration eliciting 50{\%} of maximum response): CL-316243 (beta3) {\textgreater} BRL-37344 (beta3) {\textgreater} isoproterenol (mainly beta1/beta2) {\textgreater} norepinephrine (NE; mainly beta1/beta2) {\textgreater} epinephrine (mainly beta1/beta2) {\textgreater}{\textgreater} dobutamine (beta1) {\textgreater}{\textgreater} procaterol (beta2). Schild plot coefficients of competitive inhibition experiments using ICI-89406 (beta1 antagonist) revealed that more than one type of receptor mediates NE action. It is concluded from our results that 1) NE, at low plasma levels (1-25 nM), stimulates lipolysis and respiration mainly through beta1-ARs, 2) NE, at higher levels, stimulates lipolysis and respiration via both beta1- and beta3-ARs, 3) beta2-ARs play only a minor role, and 4) beta3-ARs may represent the physiological receptors for the high NE concentrations in the synaptic cleft, where the high-affinity beta1-ARs are presumably desensitized. It is also suggested that lipolysis represents the flux-generating step regulating mitochondrial respiration.},

This commitment decision plays a fundamental role in cancer and degenerative diseases and has been proposed to be mediated by phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Here, we show that inactivation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APCCdh1) has the necessary characteristics to be the point of no return for cell-cycle entry. Our study shows that APCCdh1 inactivation is a rapid, bistable switch initiated shortly before the start of DNA replication by cyclin E/Cdk2 and made irreversible by Emi1. Exposure to stress between Rb phosphorylation and APCCdh1 inactivation, but not after APCCdh1 inactivation, reverted cells to a mitogen-sensitive quiescent state, from which they can later re-enter the cell cycle. Thus, APCCdh1 inactivation is the commitment point when cells lose the ability to return to quiescence and decide to progress through the cell cycle.},

abstract = {Phenotypic cell-to-cell variability within clonal populations may be a manifestation of 'gene expression noise', or it may reflect stable phenotypic variants. Such 'non-genetic cell individuality' can arise from the slow fluctuations of protein levels in mammalian cells. These fluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering a clonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whether this heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fate decisions in stem cells. Here we show that in clonal populations of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, spontaneous 'outlier' cells with either extremely high or low expression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a; ref. 9) reconstitute the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week. This slow relaxation is described by a gaussian mixture model that incorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles eventually reverted to that of the median cells, revealing an attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. Preference in lineage choice was associated with increased expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, such as a {\textgreater}200-fold increase in Gata1 (ref. 10) among the erythroid-prone cells, or a {\textgreater}15-fold increased PU.1 (Sfpi1) (ref. 11) expression among myeloid-prone cells. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expression level is not due to independent noise in the expression of individual genes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision. {\textcopyright}2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

Transmitting information through complex signaling networks with redundancies can overcome this limitation. We developed an integrative theoretical and experimental framework, based on the formalism of information theory, to quantitatively predict and measure the amount of information transduced by molecular and cellular networks. Analyzing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling revealed that individual TNF signaling pathways transduce information sufficient for accurate binary decisions, and an upstream bottleneck limits the information gained via multiple integrated pathways. Negative feedback to this bottleneck could both alleviate and enhance its limiting effect, despite decreasing noise. Bottlenecks likewise constrain information attained by networks signaling through multiple genes or cells.},

We found that the CD8 co-receptor fine-tunes activation thresholds, whereas the soluble hematopoietic phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) digitally regulates cell responsiveness. Stochastic variation in the expression of these proteins generates substantial diversity of activation within a clonal population of T cells, but co-regulation of CD8 and SHP-1 levels ultimately limits this very diversity. These findings reveal how eukaryotic cells can draw on regulated variation in gene expression to achieve phenotypic variability in a controlled manner.},

abstract = {Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression give rise to cell-to-cell variability in protein levels which can potentially cause variability in cellular phenotype. For TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) variability manifests itself as dramatic differences in the time between ligand exposure and the sudden activation of the effector caspases that kill cells. However, the contribution of individual proteins to phenotypic variability has not been explored in detail. In this paper we use feature-based sensitivity analysis as a means to estimate the impact of variation in key apoptosis regulators on variability in the dynamics of cell death. We use Monte Carlo sampling from measured protein concentration distributions in combination with a previously validated ordinary differential equation model of apoptosis to simulate the dynamics of receptor-mediated apoptosis. We find that variation in the concentrations of some proteins matters much more than variation in others and that precisely which proteins matter depends both on the concentrations of other proteins and on whether correlations in protein levels are taken into account. A prediction from simulation that we confirm experimentally is that variability in fate is sensitive to even small increases in the levels of Bcl-2. We also show that sensitivity to Bcl-2 levels is itself sensitive to the levels of interacting proteins. The contextual dependency is implicit in the mathematical formulation of sensitivity, but our data show that it is also important for biologically relevant parameter values. Our work provides a conceptual and practical means to study and understand the impact of cell-to-cell variability in protein expression levels on cell fate using deterministic models and sampling from parameter distributions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Gaudet et al.},

abstract = {Widespread experience indicates that application of suboptimal concentrations of stimulating ligands (secretagogues) to secretory cells elicits submaximal extents of secretion. Similarly, for permeabilized secretory cells, the extent of secretion is related to the concentration of applied intracellular effectors. We investigated the relationship between the extent of secretion from mast cells (assessed as the release of hexosaminidase) and the degranulation (exocytosis) responses of individual cells. For permeabilized mast cells stimulated by the effector combination Ca2+ plus GTP-$\gamma$-S and for intact cells stimulated by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, we found that exocytosis has the characteristics of an all-or- none process at the level of the individual cell. With a suboptimal stimulus, the population comprised only totally degranulated cells and fully replete cells. In contrast, a suboptimal concentration of compound 48/80 applied to intact cells induced a partial degree of degranulation. This was determined by observing the morphological changes accompanying degranulation by light and electron microscopy and also as a reduction in the intensity of light scattered at 90°, indicative of a change in the cell-refractive index. These results may be explained by the existence of a threshold sensitivity to the combined effectors that is set at the level of individual cells and not at the granule level. We used flow cytometry to establish the relationship between the extent of degranulation in individual rat peritoneal mast cells and the extent of secretion in the population (measured as the percentage release of total hexosaminidase). For comparison, secretion was also elicited by applying the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin or compound 48/80 to intact cells. For permeabilized cells and also for intact cells stimulated with the ionophore, levels of stimulation that generate partial secretion gave rise to bimodal frequency distributions of 90° light scatter. In contrast, a partial stimulus to secretion by compound 48/80 resulted in a single population of partially degranulated cells, the degree of degranulation varying across the cell population. The difference between the all-or-none responses of the permeabilized or ionophore-treated cells and the graded responses of cells activated by compound 48/80 is likely to stem from differences in the effective calcium stimulus. Whereas cells stimulated with receptor-directed agonists can undergo transient and localized Ca2+ changes, a homogeneous and persistent stimulus is sensed at every potential exocytotic site in the permeabilized cells.},

ERA exploits the fact that the number of cells in a particular state is related to the average transit time through that state. With this method, it is possible to calculate full time trajectories of any feature that can be labelled in fixed cells, for example levels of phosphoproteins or total cellular mass.

Using fluorescent reporters for the expression of Nanog, we observed that a population of ES cells is best described by a dynamic distribution of Nanog expression characterized by two peaks defined by high (HN) and low (LN) Nanog expression. Typically, the LN state is 5{\%}-20{\%} of the total population, depending on the culture conditions. Modelling of the activity of Nanog reveals that a simple network of Oct4/Sox2 and Nanog activity can account for the observed distribution and its properties as long as the transcriptional activity is tuned by transcriptional noise. The model also predicts that the LN state is unstable, something that is born out experimentally. While in this state, cells can differentiate. We suggest that transcriptional fluctuations in Nanog expression are an essential element of the pluripotent state and that the function of Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog is to act as a network that promotes and maintains transcriptional noise to interfere with the differentiation signals. {\textcopyright} 2009 Kalmar et al.},

abstract = {The DNA replication - division cycle of eukaryotic cells is controlled by a complex network of regulatory proteins, called cyclin-dependent kinases, and their activators and inhibitors. Although comprehensive and accurate deterministic models of the control system are available for yeast cells, reliable stochastic simulations have not been carried out because the full reaction network has yet to be expressed in terms of elementary reaction steps. As a first step in this direction, we present a simplified version of the control system that is suitable for exact stochastic simulation of intrinsic noise caused by molecular fluctuations and extrinsic noise because of unequal division. The model is consistent with many characteristic features of noisy cell cycle progression in yeast populations, including the observation that mRNAs are present in very low abundance (≈1 mRNA molecule per cell for each expressed gene). For the control system to operate reliably at such low mRNA levels, some specific mRNAs in our model must have very short half-lives ({\textless}1 min). If these mRNA molecules are longer-lived (perhaps 2 min), then the intrinsic noise in our simulations is too large, and there must be some additional noise suppression mechanisms at work in cells.},

abstract = {Hyper-insulinemia, a primary feature of insulin resistance, is associated with increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) activity. This study determined the vascular response to ET-1 and receptor binding characteristics in small mesenteric arteries of insulin-resistant (IR) rats. Rats were randomized to control (C) (n = 32) or IR (n = 32) groups. The response to ET-1 was assessed (in vitro) in arteries with (Endo+) and without (Endo-) endothelium. In addition, arteries (Endo+) were pretreated with the ETB antagonist A-192621 or the ETA antagonist A-127722. Finally, binding characteristics of [125I]ET-1 were determined. Results showed that in Endo+ arteries the maximal relaxation (Emax) to ET-1 was similar between C and IR groups; however, the concentration at 50{\%} of maximum relaxation (EC50) was decreased in IR arteries. In Endo-arteries, the Emax to ET-1 was enhanced in both groups. Pretreatment with A-192621 enhanced the Emax and EC50 to ET-1 in both groups. In contrast, A-127722 inhibited the ET-1 response in all arteries in a concentration-dependent manner; however, a greater ET-1 response was seen at each concentration in IR arteries. Maximal binding of [125I]ET-1 was increased in IR versus C arteries although the dissociation constant values were similar. In conclusion, we found the vasoconstrictor response to ET-1 is enhanced in IR arteries due to an enhanced expression of ET receptors and underlying endothelial dysfunction.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate cutaneous vasodilation and sweating responses to exogenous administration of acetylcholine (ACh) and methacholine (MCh), which have different sensitivities to endogenous cholinesterase. Four intradermal microdialysis probes were placed in dorsal forearm skin: two sites were perfused with ACh (1 × 10-7-1 M) and the other two with the same molar concentrations of MCh. Sweat rate (SR) and cutaneous blood flow were simultaneously assessed directly over each microdialysis membrane. Dose-response curves were constructed, and the effective concentration of the drug resulting in 50{\%} of the maximal response (EC50) was identified. For SR and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC), there were no significant differences in EC50 between sites receiving the same drug: -1.52 ± 0.18 and -1.19 ± 0.09 log-molar concentration of ACh at distal and proximal sites, respectively, and -2.35 ± 0.24 and -2.42 ± 0.23 log-molar concentration of MCh at distal and proximal sites, respectively, for SR (P {\textgreater} 0.05) and -3.87 ± 0.32 and -3.97 ± 0.27 log-molar concentration of ACh at distal and proximal sites, respectively, and -4.78 ± 0.17 and -4.46 ± 0.16 log-molar concentration of MCh at distal and proximal sites, respectively, for CVC (P {\textgreater} 0.05). However, the EC 50 for CVC and SR was significantly lower at the MCh than at the ACh sites. A second procedure was performed to confirm that differences in responses between ACh and MCh could be attributed to different cholinesterase sensitivities. Similarly, four microdialysis membranes were placed in dorsal forearm skin: two sites were perfused with ACh and other two with MCh. However, one of each of the ACh and MCh sites was also perfused with 10 $\mu$M neostigmine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor). Neostigmine at the ACh site induced a leftward shift (i.e., lower EC50) of the SR and CVC dose-response curves compared with the site treated with ACh alone, resulting in no difference in the EC50 for SR and CVC between the ACh +- neostigmine and the MCh site. These results suggest that elevations in SR and CVC occur earlier with MCh than with ACh treatment because of differences in cholinesterase susceptibility between these drugs.

Among them, intramolecular FRET biosensors have been increasingly used due to their high sensitivity and user-friendliness. Time-consuming optimizations by trial and error, however, obstructed the development of intramolecular FRET biosensors. Here we report an optimized backbone for rapid development of highly sensitive intramolecular FRET biosensors. The key concept is to exclude the "orientation-dependent" FRET and to render the biosensors completely "distance-dependent" with a long, flexible linker. We optimized a pair of fluorescent proteins for distance-dependent biosensors, and then developed a long, flexible linker ranging from 116 to 244 amino acids in length, which reduced the basal FRET signal and thereby increased the gain of the FRET biosensors. Computational simulations provided insight into the mechanisms by which this optimized system was the rational strategy for intramolecular FRET biosensors. With this backbone system, we improved previously reported FRET biosensors of PKA, ERK, JNK, EGFR/Abl, Ras, and Rac1. Furthermore, this backbone enabled us to develop novel FRET biosensors for several kinases of RSK, S6K, Akt, and PKC and to perform quantitative evaluation of kinase inhibitors in living cells. {\textcopyright} 2011 Komatsu et al.},

abstract = {Egg activation is the final transition that an oocyte goes through to become a developmentally competent egg. This transition is usually triggered by a calcium-based signal that is often, but not always, initiated by fertilization. Activation encompasses a number of changes within the egg. These include changes to the egg's membranes and outer coverings to prevent polyspermy and to support the developing embryo, as well as resumption and completion of the meiotic cell cycle, mRNA polyadenylation, translation of new proteins, and the degradation of specific maternal mRNAs and proteins. The transition from an arrested, highly differentiated cell, the oocyte, to a developmentally active, totipotent cell, the activated egg or embryo, represents a complete change in cellular state. This is accomplished by altering ion concentrations and by widespread changes in both the proteome and the suite of mRNAs present in the cell. Here, we review the role of calcium and zinc in the events of egg activation, and the importance of macromolecular changes during this transition. The latter include the degradation and translation of proteins, protein posttranslational regulation through phosphorylation, and the degradation, of maternal mRNAs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {For many research questions in modern molecular and systems biology, information about absolute protein quantities is imperative. This information includes, for example, kinetic modeling of processes, protein turnover determinations, stoichiometric investigations of protein complexes, or quantitative comparisons of different proteins within one sample or across samples. To date, the vast majority of proteomic studies are limited to providing relative quantitative comparisons of protein levels between limited numbers of samples. Here we describe and demonstrate the utility of a targeting MS technique for the estimation of absolute protein abundance in unlabeled and nonfractionated cell lysates. The method is based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry and the "best flyer" hypothesis, which assumes that the specific MS signal intensity of the most intense tryptic peptides per protein is approximately constant throughout a whole proteome. SRM-targeted best flyer peptides were selected for each protein from the peptide precursor ion signal intensities from directed MS data. The most intense transitions per peptide were selected from full MS/MS scans of crude synthetic analogs. We used Monte Carlo cross-validation to systematically investigate the accuracy of the technique as a function of the number of measured best flyer peptides and the number of SRM transitions per peptide. We found that a linear model based on the two most intense transitions of the three best flying peptides per proteins (TopPep3/TopTra2) generated optimal results with a cross-correlated mean fold error of 1.8 and a squared Pearson coefficient R2 of 0.88. Applying the optimized model to lysates of the microbe Leptospira interrogans, we detected significant protein abundance changes of 39 target proteins upon antibiotic treatment, which correlate well with literature values. The described method is generally applicable and exploits the inherent performance advantages of SRM, such as high sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and dynamic range, and estimates absolute protein concentrations of selected proteins at minimized costs. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

We addressed this question using metabolic pulse-chase labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry to obtain degradation profiles for thousands of proteins. We find that {\textgreater}10{\%} of proteins are degraded non-exponentially. Specifically, proteins are less stable in the first few hours of their life and stabilize with age. Degradation profiles are conserved and similar in two cell types. Many non-exponentially degraded (NED) proteins are subunits of complexes that are produced in super-stoichiometric amounts relative to their exponentially degraded (ED) counterparts. Within complexes, NED proteins have larger interaction interfaces and assemble earlier than ED subunits. Amplifying genes encoding NED proteins increases their initial degradation. Consistently, decay profiles can predict protein level attenuation in aneuploid cells. Together, our data show that non-exponential degradation is common, conserved, and has important consequences for complex formation and regulation of protein abundance.},

A fusion construct of PHPLC$\delta$ and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-PHPLC$\delta$) associates with the plasma membrane due to its association with PtdIns(4,5)P2. However, PHPLC$\delta$ has greater affinity for Ins(1,4,5)P3 than PtdIns(4,5)P2, and translocates to the cytosol as Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels rise. Prolonged activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 1$\alpha$ expressed in Chinese-hamster ovary cells or endogenous M3 muscarinic receptors in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells gave an initial transient peak in translocation, followed by a sustained plateau phase. This closely followed changes in cell population Ins(1,4,5)P3 mass, but not PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, which decreased monophasically, as determined by radioreceptor assay. Translocation thus provides a real-time method to follow increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3. Graded changes in Ins(1,4,5)P3 in Chinese-hamster ovary-lac-mGlu1$\alpha$ cells could be detected with increasing glutamate concentrations, and dual loading with fura 2 and EGFP-PHPLC$\delta$ showed that changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration closely paralleled Ins(1,4,5)P3 production. Moreover, Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization within single cells is graded in nature and dependent on both agonist concentration and receptor density.},

Using single-molecule counting and computational image analysis, we show that transcript abundance correlates with cellular volume at the single-cell level due to increased global transcription in larger cells. Cell fusion experiments establish that increased cellular content itself can directly increase transcription. Quantitative analysis shows that this mechanism measures the ratio of cellular volume to DNA content, most likely through sequestration of a transcriptional factor to DNA. Analysis of transcriptional bursts reveals a separate mechanism for gene dosage compensation after DNA replication that enables proper transcriptional output during early and late S phase. Our results provide a framework for quantitatively understanding the relationships among DNA content, cell size, and gene expression variability in single cells.},

These surface contraction waves (SCWs) begin at the animal pole and progress around the egg, occur every cell cycle and precede cleavage [1-3]. The SCWs are biphasic, comprising a relaxation phase (SCWa) and a contraction phase (SCWb). To investigate how these events are linked to the underlying cell cycle, we studied the temporal and spatial relationship between the SCWs and previously characterized biochemical markers of cell-cycle progression. We found that the relaxation phase was a response to activated maturation-promoting factor (MPF). In contrast, the contraction phase required inactivation of MPF and was blocked when MPF activity was maintained at elevated levels. We also found that a wave of MPF activity traveled within the cell from the animal to the vegetal hemisphere. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the SCWs are a local response to a wave of MPF activation and inactivatlon. The egg cytoplasm, therefore, is metachronous in terms of cell-cycle progression; multiple cell-cycle states are present and spatially distinct within the egg at the same time.},

abstract = {The transmission of extracellular signals into their intracellular targets is mediated by a network of interacting proteins that regulate a large number of cellular processes. Cumulative efforts from many laboratories over the past decade have allowed the elucidation of one such signaling mechanism, which involves activations of several membranal signaling molecules followed by a sequential stimulation of several cytoplasmic protein kinases collectively known as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Up to six tiers in this cascade contribute to the amplification and specificity of the transmitted signals that eventually activate several regulatory molecules in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus to initiate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and development. Moreover, because many oncogenes have been shown to encode proteins that transmit mitogenic signals upstream of this cascade, the MAPK pathway provides a simple unifying explanation for the mechanism of action of most, if not all, nonnuclear oncogenes. The pattern of MAPK cascade is not restricted to growth factor signaling and it is now known that signaling pathways initiated by phorbol esters, ionophors, heat shock, and ligands for seven transmembrane receptors use distinct MAPK cascades with little or no cross-reactivity between them. In this review we emphasize primarily the first MAPK cascade to be discovered that uses the MEK and ERK isoforms and describe their involvement in different cellular processes.},

In the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), calcium (Ca2+), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) pathways, response dynamics resulted in significantly greater information transmission capacities compared to nondynamic responses. Theoretical analysis demonstrated that signaling dynamics has a key role in overcoming extrinsic noise. Experimental measurements of information transmission in the ERK network under varying signal-to-noise levels confirmed our predictions and showed that signaling dynamics mitigate, and can potentially eliminate, extrinsic noise-induced information loss.

We measured fluctuations over time in the levels of 20 endogenous proteins in living human cells, tagged by the gene for yellow fluorescent protein at their chromosomal loci. We found variability with a standard deviation that ranged, for different proteins, from about 15{\%} to 30{\%} of the mean. Mixing between high and low levels occurred for all proteins, but the mixing time was longer than two cell generations (more than 40 h) for many proteins. We also tagged pairs of proteins with two colours, and found that the levels of proteins in the same biological pathway were far more correlated than those of proteins in different pathways. The persistent memory for protein levels that we found might underlie individuality in cell behaviour and could set a timescale needed for signals to affect fully every member of a cell population. {\textcopyright}2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

Owing to the increase in obesity, life expectancy may start to decrease in developed countries for the first time in recent history. The factors determining fat mass in adult humans are not fully understood, but increased lipid storage in already developed fat cells (adipocytes) is thought to be most important. Here we show that adipocyte number is a major determinant for the fat mass in adults. However, the number of fat cells stays constant in adulthood in lean and obese individuals, even after marked weight loss, indicating that the number of adipocytes is set during childhood and adolescence. To establish the dynamics within the stable population of adipocytes in adults, we have measured adipocyte turnover by analysing the integration of 14C derived from nuclear bomb tests in genomic DNA. Approximately 10{\%} of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass index. Neither adipocyte death nor generation rate is altered in early onset obesity, suggesting a tight regulation of fat cell number in this condition during adulthood. The high turnover of adipocytes establishes a new therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in obesity. {\textcopyright}2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survivea striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding fractional killing of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Stochasticity is a hallmark of cellular processes, and different classes of genes show large differences in their cell-to-cell variability (noise). To decipher the sources and consequences of this noise, we systematically measured pairwise correlations between large numbers of genes, including those with high variability. We find that there is substantial pathway variability shared across similarly regulated genes. This induces quantitative correlations in the expression of functionally related genes such as those involved in the Msn2/4 stress response pathway, amino-acid biosynthesis, and mitochondrial maintenance. Bioinformatic analyses and genetic perturbations suggest that fluctuations in PKA and Tor signaling contribute to pathway-specific variability. Our results argue that a limited number of well-delineated " noise regulons" operate across a yeast cell and that such coordinated fluctuations enable a stochastic but coherent induction of functionally related genes. Finally, we show that pathway noise is a quantitative tool for exploring pathway features and regulatory relationships in un-stimulated systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

We show that the three-tiered kinase amplifier module combined with negative feedback recapitulates the design principles of a negative feedback amplifier (NFA), which is used in electronic circuits to confer robustness, output stabilization, and linearization of nonlinear signal amplification. We used mathematical modeling and experimental validation to demonstrate that the ERK pathway has properties of an NFA that (i) converts intrinsic switch-like activation kinetics into graded linear responses, (ii) conveys robustness to changes in rates of reactions within the NFA module, and (iii) stabilizes outputs in response to drug-induced perturbations of the amplifier. These properties determine biological behavior, including activation kinetics and the response to drugs. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Association for the Advancement of Science.},

abstract = {Signal transduction networks allow eukaryotic cells to make decisions based on information about intracellular state and the environment. Biochemical noise significantly diminishes the fidelity of signaling: Networks examined to date seem to transmit less than 1 bit of information. It is unclear how networks that control critical cell-fate decisions (e.g., cell division and apoptosis) can function with such low levels of information transfer. Here, we use theory, experiments, and numerical analysis to demonstrate an inherent trade-off between the information transferred in individual cells and the information available to control population-level responses. Noise in receptormediated apoptosis reduces information transfer to approximately 1 bit at the single-cell level but allows 3-4 bits of information to be transmitted at the population level. For processes such as eukaryotic chemotaxis, in which single cells are the functional unit, we find high levels of information transmission at a single-cell level. Thus, low levels of information transfer are unlikely to represent a physical limit. Instead, we propose that signaling networks exploit noise at the single-cell level to increase population-level information transfer, allowing extracellular ligands, whose levels are also subject to noise, to incrementally regulate phenotypic changes. This is particularly critical for discrete changes in fate (e.g., life vs. death) for which the key variable is the fraction of cells engaged. Our findings provide a framework for rationalizing the high levels of noise in metazoan signaling networks and have implications for the development of drugs that target these networks in the treatment of cancer and other diseases.},

However, it remains unclear how these elements combine to control cellular behavior. We analyzed the probabilistic and transient differentiation of Bacillus subtilis cells into the state of competence. A few key parameters independently tuned the frequency of initiation and the duration of competence episodes and allowed the circuit to access different dynamic regimes, including oscillation. Altering circuit architecture showed that the duration of competence events can be made more precise. We used an experimental method to reduce global cellular noise and showed that noise levels are correlated with frequency of differentiation events. Together, the data reveal a noise-dependent circuit that is remarkably resilient and tunable in terms of its dynamic behavior.},

The last several years have witnessed an explosion of new technologies, allowing us to apply even more of the modern molecular biology toolkit to single cells. Conceptual progress, however, has been comparatively slow. Here, we provide a framework for classifying both the origins of the differences between individual cells and the consequences of those differences. We discuss how the concept of "random" differences is context dependent, and propose that rigorous definitions of inputs and outputs may bring clarity to the discussion. We also categorize ways in which probabilistic behavior may influence cellular function, highlighting studies that point to exciting future directions in the field.},

abstract = {Variability within isogenic T cell populations yields heterogeneous ‘local' signaling responses to shared antigenic stimuli, but responding clones may communicate ‘global' antigen load through paracrine messengers, such as cytokines. Such coordination of individual cell responses within multicellular populations is critical for accurate collective reactions to shared environmental cues. However, cytokine production may saturate as a function of antigen input, or be dominated by the precursor frequency of antigen-specific T cells. Surprisingly, we found that T cells scale their collective output of IL-2 to total antigen input over a large dynamic range, independently of population size. Through experimental quantitation and computational modeling, we demonstrate that this scaling is enforced by an inhibitory cross-talk between antigen and IL-2 signaling, and a nonlinear acceleration of IL-2 secretion per cell. Our study reveals how time-integration of these regulatory loops within individual cell signaling generates scaled collective responses and can be leveraged for immune monitoring.},

abstract = {During the early development of Xenopus laevis embryos, the first mitotic cell cycle is long ({\~{}}85 min) and the subsequent 11 cycles are short ({\~{}}30 min) and clock-like. Here we address the question of how the Cdk1 cell cycle oscillator changes between these two modes of operation. We found that the change can be attributed to an alteration in the balance between Wee1/Myt1 and Cdc25. The change in balance converts a circuit that acts like a positive-plus-negative feedback oscillator, with spikes of Cdk1 activation, to one that acts like a negative-feedback-only oscillator, with a shorter period and smoothly varying Cdk1 activity. Shortening the first cycle, by treating embryos with the Wee1A/Myt1 inhibitor PD0166285, resulted in a dramatic reduction in embryo viability, and restoring the length of the first cycle in inhibitor-treated embryos with low doses of cycloheximide partially rescued viability. Computations with an experimentally parameterized mathematical model show that modest changes in the Wee1/Cdc25 ratio can account for the observed qualitative changes in the cell cycle. The high ratio in the first cycle allows the period to be long and tunable, and decreasing the ratio in the subsequent cycles allows the oscillator to run at a maximal speed. Thus, the embryo rewires its feedback regulation to meet two different developmental requirements during early development. {\textcopyright} 2014 Tsai et al.},

abstract = {Regulation of cell proliferation is necessary for immune responses, tissue repair, and upkeep of organ function to maintain human health. When proliferating cells complete mitosis, a fraction of newly born daughter cells immediately enter the next cell cycle, while the remaining cells in the same population exit to a transient or persistent quiescent state. Whether this choice between two cell-cycle pathways is due to natural variability in mitogen signalling or other underlying causes is unknown. Here we show that human cells make this fundamental cell-cycle entry or exit decision based on competing memories of variable mitogen and stress signals. Rather than erasing their signalling history at cell-cycle checkpoints before mitosis, mother cells transmit DNA damage-induced p53 protein and mitogen-induced cyclin D1 (CCND1) mRNA to newly born daughter cells. After mitosis, the transferred CCND1 mRNA and p53 protein induce variable expression of cyclin D1 and the CDK inhibitor p21 that almost exclusively determines cell-cycle commitment in daughter cells. We find that stoichiometric inhibition of cyclin D1-CDK4 activity by p21 controls the retinoblastoma (Rb) and E2F transcription program in an ultrasensitive manner. Thus, daughter cells control the proliferation-quiescence decision by converting the memories of variable mitogen and stress signals into a competition between cyclin D1 and p21 expression. We propose a cell-cycle control principle based on natural variation, memory and competition that maximizes the health of growing cell populations.},

abstract = {Tissue homeostasis in metazoans is regulated by transitions of cells between quiescence and proliferation. The hallmark of proliferating populations is progression through the cell cycle, which is driven by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Here, we introduce a live-cell sensor for CDK2 activity and unexpectedly found that proliferating cells bifurcate into two populations as they exit mitosis. Many cells immediately commit to the next cell cycle by building up CDK2 activity from an intermediate level, while other cells lack CDK2 activity and enter a transient state of quiescence. This bifurcation is directly controlled by the CDK inhibitor p21 and is regulated by mitogens during a restriction window at the end of the previous cell cycle. Thus, cells decide at the end of mitosis to either start the next cell cycle by immediately building up CDK2 activity or to enter a transient G0-like state by suppressing CDK2 activity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license Due to noise in the synthesis and degradation of proteins, the concentrations of individual vertebrate signaling proteins were estimated to vary with a coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 25{\%} between cells. Such high variation is beneficial for population-level regulation of cell functions but abolishes accurate single-cell signal transmission. Here, we measure cell-to-cell variability of relative protein abundance using quantitative proteomics of individual Xenopus laevis eggs and cultured human cells and show that variation is typically much lower, in the range of 5–15{\%}, compatible with accurate single-cell transmission. Focusing on bimodal ERK signaling, we show that variation and covariation in MEK and ERK expression improves controllability of the percentage of activated cells, demonstrating how variation and covariation in expression enables population-level control of binary cell-fate decisions. Together, our study argues for a control principle whereby low expression variation enables accurate control of analog single-cell signaling, while increased variation, covariation, and numbers of pathway components are required to widen the stimulus range over which external inputs regulate binary cell activation to enable precise control of the fraction of activated cells in a population.},
